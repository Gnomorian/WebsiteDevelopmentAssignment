										<h3>KT Rolster, a legendary team in the Korean E-Sports scene, from victory to victory, leaving everyone behind while they carve out there own legacy as a truly great organisation in the history of E-Sports.</h3>
										<p>KT Rolster is a Korean professional gaming organization based in South Korea. A powerhouse in both StarCraft 2 and League Of Legends, with players such as Score, Zest and of course the great Flash, KT is truly a organisation at the top of E-Sports. KT Rolster's StarCraft 2 team is probably one of the greatest at the moment, with players like Zest and Life. With Zest having just come of a truly incredible victory at the international tournament IEM Katowice, winning the $100,000 prize. Little needs to be said about the other player mentioned above, Life, probably the greatest StarCraft 2 player of all time so far, 2013 and 2014 were amazing years for him. Winning every tournament in sight nearly and carrying his team to multiple victories. His greatest of all though is probably his 2014 WCS Global Finals victory against MMA in which he became the undisputed best player and took home a cool $100,000. Kt Rolster StarCraft team look set for even more victories in 2015 with players such as trhe StarCraft Brood War legend Flash starting to pick up speed, the future looks bright for KT Rolster in there StarCraft 2 adventures. KT Rolster League Of Legends team is also highly prestigious as well, winning the 2014 IEM World Championship and coming close to multiple OGN Championship victories before finally winning in Summer 2015. The current KT Rolster League Of Legends Team has been going through a rough patch but finally looks to be on the way out. They started the 2015 season looking strong in pre-season, but when the season started they just couldn't seem to pick up the victories they use to. They ended up missing out of the OGN Champions Spring 2015 Play-offs just, even with a late surge at the end of the season. This current OGN Summer 2015 though has seen KT Rolster look like one of the top teams once again. They currently sit in 3rd position behind CJ Entus and SK Telecom, but with the season far from over, who knows, maybe once again we will see a vintage KT Rolster performance through the play-offs and see them hoisting the OGN Champions trophy again. Overall KT Rolster is one of the most popular organisations in all of Korea, and rightfully so, they have carved a legacy of excellence that few can claim to match, there are few certainties in life but KT being a top team seems to be one of them.</p>
