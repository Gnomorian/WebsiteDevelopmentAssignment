											<p>OnGameNet is a South Korean cable television company which organizes the largest series of Korean League of Legends tournaments, The Champions. Champions first started back in March 2012 and was one of the first League Of Legends tournaments in Korea, it was certainly the biggest at the time and has remained the biggest since then. The Champions use to follow a seasonal schedule of winter, spring and summer, holding a tournament for each of these. These tournaments started with a round of 16 round robin in 4 groups of 4. 2 Teams from each group advanced to the quarter-finals. The play-offs were all settled in best-of-5 matches. But in 2015 OGN changed there tournament format to a league format and cut the number of teams down to 8. With this new tournament format they also decided to axe the winter league and just have spring and summer from then on. It is also important to note that the League Of Legends world championship for the last two years has always been won by a team that competed in OGN the Champions. Even with the change to there tournament format Champions is still regarded as the premier league both in Korea and around the world. </p>

										<p>Challengers Korea is run by NiceGameTV, it is a very new tournament which recently started it's first season in February this year. It is run as a sort of development league in Korea where the top teams from it and promoted to OGN the Champions for the next season. The teams that can compete in this league can be ameteur or professional, some teams are just high-schoolers who have made a team together and are all high level players who want to see how far they can go. While others can be professional teams who are fighting to get into the fully professional league OGN the Champions. The format for Challengers Korea is 16 playing in a round of 16 where matches are best-of-3 and the finals that make it out of the round of 16 play in the semi-finals and final which are best-of-5. Overall Challengers Korea is a league that is still growing, as it has only just started, but it is already showing that it provides an important gap between professional teams and ameteur teams, without this we wouldn't be able to see so many new talents emerging in the Korea League of Legends scene. The future of this tournament is only going to raise as it goes on and after such a great first season i for one am looking very forward to the next.</p>
