										<h3>Samsung, A legendary organisation, known for producing great players and teams, there most recent victory came at the League Of Legends World Championship 2014. </h3>
										<p>Samsung Galaxy is a Korean a professional gaming team based in South Korea, part of KeSPA. The organization previously sponsored two sister teams, Samsung White and Samsung Blue. Founded in 2005, its StarCraft division, Samsung KHAN, counts current World Elite coach Lee Seung-Eun (Firebathero) among the stars that have been on its roster. They are sponsored by the the multi-national, billionaire company Samsung. Previously known as Samsung Khan, Samsung has been involved in the E-Sports scene in Korea for many years now, previously in the StarCraft : Brood War scene, but after that game died, they moved onto StarCraft 2 and League Of Legends. Since then they have been on of the most successful E-Sports organisations in Korea, winning multiple tournaments in both games. There past players are truly legends on E-Sports in Korea, such as Dade, Dandy, Mata, Imp, Deft, truly legends of there games, and current players such as stork and wraith, Samsung is known for there pedigree of players. Samsung's League of Legends havn't such been the best in Korea with there results of competing in the Masters 2014 tournament, finishing second in the round robin and then beating CJ Entus 2-0 and SK Telecom T1 3-0 to win the tournament. With that victory and both Samsung teams, White and Samsung Blue placing well in multiple seasons of Champions and qualifying for Worlds in 2014, with White winning, the Samsung organization was recognized as one of the strongest in the history of OGN Champions, considering the strength of both of its teams. When KeSPA announced their new format for OGN and the prohibition against one organization holding multiple rosters, Samsung released all of its players on both rosters. The team was invited to compete in Champions Spring 2015. On December 2nd, 2014 a preliminary roster for that tournament was announced, including cuvee, Eve, BlisS, Fury, and Wraith. Samsung finished in last place in the round robin, with a 2-12 set record and a 2-26 game record, forcing them to play in the Promotion Tournament. This truly was a dark moment for Samsung organisation, who had just come off of winning the League Of legends world Championship. They were placed in a group with Prime Clan and Xenics and won both of their sets, qualifying for the summer season in glorious fashion. Looking like a new team with a few new players the new OGN Champions season is looking bright and hopefully Samsung can return to past glories. Prior to the start of the summer season, they added substitute players Crown and Luna, expanding their roster to 9 players, it is hoped that these new players will usher in a new era of Samsung domination. </p>
