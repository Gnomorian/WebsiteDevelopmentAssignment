										<h3>SK Telecom, a truely fearsome organisation, always producing the best teams and currently has the undisputed best E-Sports player, Sanghyuk "Faker" Lee. </h3>
										<p>SK Telecom T1 is a Korean professional gaming team based in South Korea. They are a powerhouse in both League of Legends and StarCraft 2. Their players include legends such as Faker, Bengi, Innovation and soO. Also past greats such as Piglet, Impact, Poohmandu, PartinG and of course Bisu. Their StarCraft 2 team has had a tough start to 2015, not having won any tournaments so far, but back in 2014 Innovation and Classic both brought many tournaments wins to the team, both in Korea and overseas. It is hoped that they all follow this trend again this year when they find there form again. In December 2012, SK Telecom acquired the roster of Eat Sleep Game, with a roster consisting of Reapered, H0R0, MighTiLy, UandME, and StarLast. In February 2013, the organization created a new roster, which consisted of Faker, bengi, Piglet, PoohManDu, and Impact. After a great 2013, which included winning the League Of legends World Championship, 2014 was a year to forgot for SK Telecom as they missed out of qualification for the tournament all together. On November 12th, the sister teams were renamed from #1 and #2 to S and K, respectively. Though it was initially known as SK Telecom's secondary team, K outperformed S, winning the Season 3 World Championship and then having a perfect season in Champions Winter 2013-2014. In November 2014, it was announced that Korean teams could no longer have two separate rosters, and SK Telecom T1's teams disbanded, reforming a single team simply called SK Telecom T1. SK Telecom competed in LoL Masters 2014. The organization had a 6-0 set record in the round robin, with a 14-4 game record. In the playoffs, they were seeded directly into the finals but then lost 0-3 to Samsung, placing second overall. As with all other OGN teams, they would have a 10-member roster. The team was invited to play in Champions Spring 2015. On December 2nd, a roster was announced for the preseason that included MaRin, Impact, Bengi, Easyhoon, Faker, Bang, Wolf, and Piccaboo. Of these players, Piccaboo was the only new addition; the other seven players had previously competed on either S or K. SK Telecom's League Of Legends team on the other hand has returned to being a powerhouse team in 2015, they recently won the OGN Champions spring season in impressive fashion, beating GE Tigers 3-0 in the final. Overall SK Telecom is a organisation that is always at the top of E-Sports in multiple games, and is to many the greatest organisation in all of E-Sports.</p>
