											<h3>KT Rolster Zest</h3>

											<p>Joo "Zest" Sung Wook, also known as "Wooki" and "P7GAB", is a professional Protoss player from South Korea who currently plays for KT Rolster. Zest played his first official StarCraft II match during the hybrid 2011-2012 Proleague Season 2, garnering a total of 5 wins and 4 loses.One of his first appearances in the foreign scene was at the IEM Season VIII New York.First, he qualified through the Korean and Taiwan Qualifier. In the first stage of the qualifier, he defeated MC, ByuL, SuperNova and Savage, only dropping one map to ByuL. In the second stage of the qualifier, Squirtle knocked him down to the losers' bracket with the score of 2-0. However, he qualified through the losers' bracket by defeating Check, HerO and Pigbaby.Finally, it was time for the IEM Season IX World Championship in Katowice. Having secured a spot with his IEM Toronto run, Zest was set to play against ROOT Gaming’s Hydra. Zest was considered as the underdog in the match up by the analyst desk, but he won with a close score of 3-2 after a reverse sweep that included a lengthy defence in Game 5 against a Roach-Hydra composition.Then in the quarterfinals, he faced INnoVation who had just beaten Life (the BlizzCon champion) in a close series. This time in a back and forth series, with each player never winning more than one game in a row, Zest was able to narrowly win with the score of 3-2 by defending INnoVation’s SCV pull on Expedition Lost. In the semifinals, he had to play against another Terran in the form of CJ Entus’s Bbyong. After a couple of mildly cheesy games that included a two-base blink all-in and heavy Dark Templar play, Zest was able to win the series 3-1 by holding Bbyong’s botched SCV pull on Catallena in Game 4.On the next evening, in the finals, Zest was pitted against Trap whom he has a winning record against. It would also be the only Protoss vs Protoss series of the tournament. The series was littered with macro oriented games and Stargate based strategies, most notably Game 4 on Deadwing in which each player made a Mothership and air-based armies. Zest won the title with the score of 4-1, taking home the $68,707.</p>

											<h3>SK Telecom Innovation</h3>
											<p>Lee "INnoVation" Shin Hyung, also known as "Bogus", is a StarCraft progamer from South Korea. He is currently playing for SK Telecom T1. INnoVation played in the first ever Heart of the Swarm MLG event shortly after the release of the expansion. He dominated his first three matches, taking out the Canadian player HuK, the multiple MLG champion Leenock and his fellow KeSPA player Rain all by 3-0 scores. He met the legendary Brood War Terran Flash in the semi-finals where Flash showcased his superior TvT to take the series 3-1. Dropping down into the third place match, INnoVation played another Protoss player in MC, another decorated StarCraft II player. He defeated the Protoss player 2-1 which secured him a third place finish in the first official premier Heart of the Swarm tournament. After losing the WCS Season 3 Korea finals 3-4 against Soulkey despite leading 3-0, INnoVation sought revenge at the 2015 WCS Season 3 Global Finals. He was able to advance in first place from his initial group stage, still showing great form in TvZ, defeating RorO and Revival, and secured himself a spot in the quarterfinals where he would face aLive. Showing that he was capable in more than just TvZ, INnoVation swept aLive 3-0. He then went on to defeat Mvp in a very close series 3-2 to advance to his second consecutive premier finals, where he faced off against sOs, a player who had played two very close series against INnoVation's rival Soulkey in both the WCS 2013 Season 1 Korea semifinals and WCS 2015 Season 3 semifinals. INnoVation once again started the series 3-0 without showing signs of weakness. The fourth game, however, was much more difficult, as sOs used an unusual Tempest/Templar composition to test INnoVation's ability to adapt. He was not shaken, and he closed the series 4-0 against sOs who looked visibly nervous, and finally found himself a champion on one of the biggest stages in StarCraft 2 history. His accomplishment earned him the #1 rank on TeamLiquid.net's Power Rank for June 2015.</p>

											<h3>MVP MarineKing</h3>
											<p>Lee "MarineKing" Jung Hoon is a Terran player from South Korea who is currently playing for MVP. In MarineKing's first big offline tournament, the 2012 Sony Ericsson Starcraft II Open Season 2 (GSL 2), he demonstrated his superb micromanagement and heavily Marine-based play, defeating Banelings with only marines by stimming and splitting groups of Marines in multiple directions. He quickly distinguished himself as one of the top Terrans in the world by defeating FruitDealer, also known as Cool, in the round of 32. FruitDealer was the 2010 TG Sambo Intel Starcraft II Open Season 1 champion, so MarineKing's 2-0 victory came as a surprise to much of the community. MarineKing then went on to the round of 16 to face FruitDealer's team mate at the time SangHo, also known as BabyByeBye, where he secured another 2-0 victory. He next faced Kyrix, a player known for his aggressive Baneling style, in the round of 8. MarineKing showcased his excellent Marine micro throughout this series, winning 3-2 and cementing his popularity through his exciting style of play. In the round of 4, MarineKing defeated GSL 1 runner up HopeTorture, now known as RainBOw, winning 4-1. In the final, he was defeated by NesTea 4-3, making him the only player in that tournament to win a game against NesTea. His usage of the 2Rax strategy throughout the tournament popularized the now notorious build. At the end of 2014, MarineKing qualified for the HOT6 CUP, surprising everyone. He then managed to 4-0 his group, defeating Protoss players herO and Stats easily, then smashed PartinG 3:0 in the Ro8, showcasing his new safe play style. At the finals event, he defeated Zest in a very close series, advancing to the finals of a Korean tournament for the first time since 2011. Going into the finals, MarineKing had a 10-2 record in TvP matches in the HOT6 CUP. Unfortunately, in the finals he fell 4-1 to sOs, who employed a lot of early game pokes and rushes, which MarineKing was unable to hold as he started to choke and his micro betrayed him.After his impressive run in the HOT6 CUP, MarineKing qualified for the 2015 Global StarCraft II League Season 1 Code S, as well as for the newly established 2015 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 1 Challenge. Then on May 8, 2015, he managed to get into quarterfinals of the 2015 DreamHack Open Tours in France, where he lost 3-0 to GuMiho.</p>

											<h3>JinAir Greenwings Maru</h3>
											<p>Cho "Maru" Seong Ju is a Terran player from South Korea, who is currently playing for Jin Air Green Wings. He is well known for being the youngest GSL player of all time, winning his first televised game at the age of 13.Maru made his professional debut in the very first GSL, the 2010 TG Sambo Intel Starcraft II Open Season 1. There, he defeated fan favorite Cella 2-1 to advance to the Ro32, where he lost 0-2 to San. The series against San would be Maru's last games in the GSL for almost a year; he did not qualify for Code A until GSL August, where he fell 0-2 to Fruitdealer in the Round of 32. Maru's attempts to qualify for GSL October and GSL November also failed, though the single game he took off of Curious during the October preliminaries was Curious's only loss that season. Maru was able to qualify for WCS Korea 2013 Season 2 Premier League, hosted by OGN, through the Up and Down matches by losing to Leenock and winning against Ruin, Bunny and DongRaeGu. He defeated sOs twice in the round of 32, and Trap and SuperNova 2-1 each in the round of 16 to reach the bracket stage of the tournament. After handily defeating perennial Code S/Premier League player Symbol, he was matched against the WCS Season 1 Finals champion INnoVation. According to the TeamLiquid Power Rank and Aligulac rating website, INnoVation was rated the best player in the world at the time, and was the heavy favorite in the matchup. However, by using highly varying, cheesy, and aggressive builds, Maru was able to take the first three games without difficulty, and took advantage of a shaken up INnoVation to close the series 4-0 in a fairly standard game. This brought him to the first finals of his career against Rain, where after dropping the initial two games, Maru took the third game with a proxy 11/11 which gave him the momentum to end up winning the championship 4-2.</p>

											<h3>KT Rolster Life</h3>
											<p>Lee "Life" Seung Hyun is a professional Zerg player from South Korea currently playing for the team KT Rolster. Life's career as a professional StarCraft II player began in March 2011 when he joined team ZeNEX. At 14 years of age and being six months older than Maru, he was one of the youngest progamers in the South Korean scene. Life's first appearance at an official tournament came on July 4, when he competed in the iCCup Korean Weekly #4. In that tournament, he knocked-out PuMa before beating Hack 3-0. Life ultimately placed second in that tournament, losing to JYP in the finals. The outcomes of his participation in the iCCup South Korean Weekly in the following two weeks were significantly poorer. He was eliminated by his first opponent, Lucky, in iCCup Korean Weekly #5, and he placed last in his iCCup Korean Weekly Season 1 Finals #1 group.He achieved his first success with his victory at the iCCup Korean Weekly #6, where he beat jjakji, 4-3 in finals. Life continued to participate in these events (which were renamed ESV TV Korean Weekly on August 27, after the dissolution of iCCup TV) until the end of the first season in December. However, he was never able to go any further than the quarterfinals as he was frequently eliminated in the first rounds of the tournament on a regular basis. He was nonetheless invited to the ESV Korean Weekly Season 1 Finals #3, where he topped his group with two wins over InCa and Puzzle. He ended up losing to Squirtle in the quarterfinals. On March 15th 2014, Life attended the first Heart of the Swarm tournament after release, at 2013 MLG Winter Championship. Coming into the event, many people gave the Zerg players almost no chance in the event, due to some supposedly heavy balance issues. But Life proved once again why he is a force to be reckoned with. Life cruised through a defenseless Minigun in the round of 32, setting him up against Polt in the round of 16. The match was incredibly back and forth, but one thing stood out: Life's super aggressive Muta Ling Bane style, which carried him to a 3-2 victory. In the quarter finals, Life's opponent was STX Soul's Last. Once again spectators witnessed a back and forth match and Life's aggressive style won him another close 3-2 victory. In the semi-finals Life met the Protoss powerhouse MC, an opponent who had been on a tear through heavy hitters such as herO, MVP and Bomber. Unfortunately for MC, Life crushed MC in a short 3-0 victory, setting him up for a potential back to back MLG championship.</p>
