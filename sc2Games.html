										<h2>What is StarCraft 2?</h2>
										<p>StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty is the sequel to the original StarCraft, Blizzard Entertainment’s critically acclaimed sci-fi real-time strategy game, that also lauched the E-Sports world in korea. StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty is both a challenging single-player game and a fast-paced multiplayer game, and it also taps into Battle.net. Blizzard Entertainment’s fully-featured online gaming service. It's also a real-time strategy game, in these sorts of games players build armies and vie for control of the battlefield. The armies in play can be as small as a single squad of Marines or as large as a full-blown planetary invasion force. As commander, you observe the battlefield from a top-down perspective and issue orders to your units in real time. Strategic thinking is key to success; you need to gather information about your opponents, anticipate their moves, outflank their attacks, and formulate a winning strategy.</p>
										<h2 class="tourHeading">Overview of StarCraft 2</h2>
										<p>The Wings of Liberty Campaign follows the exploits of the Terran outlaws Jim Raynor and Tychus Findlay. Specifically, the player is assumed to have the role of Raynor from a third-person perspective. The first three missions must be completed in order, after which a series of events occur which enables the player to begin directing the order in which missions are played. New units are acquired during each mission which may then be used in any future missions (except the Prophecy missions, in which the player does not use Terran units). In some cases, the capability to produce a particular type of unit can dramatically alter the challenge of a given mission. Many of the missions force the player to take a defensive position (in contrast to multiplayer) which makes Siege Tanks a particularly beneficial unit to unlock as early as possible. Each mission can be completed using Casual, Normal, Hard, or Brutal difficulty. New players who have never played any video game in their entire life or are just new to RTS (Real time strategy) type games should probably begin on Normal - the Casual difficulty is very, very casual, to the point that enemies only very rarely attack and usually sit about waiting for the player to come and slaughter them - and their units have only half of their normal HP. In most cases, playing on Hard or Brutal adds more depth to a mission. For example, in the Zero Hour mission on Normal difficulty the player has to deal with only the assaults of the Zerg, whereas in Hard and Brutal there are Zerg "drop pods" that crash into the ground delivering Creep Tumors and Zerglings. These drop pods gradually begin to descend closer and closer to the player's base, and since Zerg units move more rapidly on Creep, this can ramp up the challenge quickly. Most missions reward the player with Credits, as well as the potential to acquire Research points by completing side objectives (see below for more details on both). All missions also feature achievement challenges. In most cases, there is one challenge for completing all of the side objectives which can be obtained on any difficulty, one challenge that can only be finished on at least Normal difficulty, and one challenge that can only be finished on at least Hard difficulty. Playing every mission on at least Hard difficulty is generally an easy way to enable a savvy player to complete all achievements on a single play of the mission.</p>
										<h2 class="tourHeading">The Races of StarCraft 2</h2>
										<p class="tourBold">StarCraft II features three distinct ’races’ whose armies comprise entirely unique units and structures. Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses, and knowing their tactical profiles can mean the difference between glorious victory or crushing defeat.</p>
										<h3 class="tourSubHeading">Terran</h3>

										<p>The terrans are relative newcomers to the Koprulu sector. They are the descendents of a disastrous colonization expedition launched from Earth centuries ago, its human cargo made up of dissidents and malcontents the government deemed expendable. The survivors of the expedition established three colonies that became the basis for the major power blocs in terran space: the Confederacy, the Kel-Morian Combine, and the Umojan Protectorate. The corrupt Confederacy was overthrown by terrorist and revolutionary Arcturus Mengsk during the chaos of the zerg invasion. Now the Terran Dominion has emerged from the ashes of the old Confederacy as the dominant power, ruled by none other than Emperor Arcturus I.Forced to adapt to the harsh existence on the mostly lifeless worlds of the sector, the terrans are masters of survival. With neither the advanced technology of the protoss nor the natural prowess of the zerg to rely on, the terran military forces consist of a varied mix of units. From basic but effective infantry like the Marines to heavily armed battle cruisers, terran units rely on solid armor, plentiful firepower, and strength in numbers to hold the line. Terrans excel in defensive situations where their bunkers and Siege Tanks really shine.</p>
										<h3 class="tourSubHeading">Protoss</h3>
										<figure>

										</figure>
										<p>With their highly advanced technology and potent psionic abilities, the protoss once considered themselves the most powerful species in the galaxy. Their war with the zerg has proved otherwise: even the most individually capable warrior cannot overcome such insurmountable numbers. The lesson has been a hard one for the protoss, for their society is built around core philosophies that have been rigidly adhered to for over a thousand years. However, the zerg invasion of the protoss homeworld of Aiur has brought the race to a crossroads: the protoss must embrace change if they are to survive and prevail. Now new tactics and technologies are being brought to bear in the increasingly desperate battle against the zerg, and ancient, terrible weapons the protoss set aside long ago are being unleashed. The protoss have never been a prolific people and have traditionally bolstered their numbers with a variety of robotic war machines. Individual protoss warriors are unsurpassed in their skills, greatly enhanced by the combination of technology and formidable psionic strength. Nonetheless, the protoss must rely on mobility and surprise to maximize their advantages without getting drawn into a battle of attrition. One of their greatest strengths lies in their fleet, which boasts a variety of ships powerful enough to pound an enemy to atoms.</p>
										<h3 class="tourSubHeading">Zerg</h3>
										<figure>
											<img src="images/starCraft/game/zergUnit.jpg" alt="zerg unit">

										</figure>
										<p>When the zerg first arrived in the Koprulu sector, they were unified by their absolute obedience to the zerg collective sentience known as the Overmind. The Overmind directed the actions of every zerg creature in the Swarm, functioning through a hierarchy of lesser sentients. Although the Overmind was primarily driven by its desire to consume and assimilate the advanced protoss race, it found useful but undeveloped material in humanity. By taking a powerful terran psionic, Sarah Kerrigan, the Overmind evolved a new and unique creature: the Queen of Blades. After the protoss destroyed the Overmind during the invasion of Aiur, the Queen of Blades eventually came to dominate the Swarm. The zerg are entirely unlike the terrans and the protoss. They are composed of many different species that were integrated into the Swarm via zerg infestation. Such creatures are rapidly and selectively evolved into ruthless killing machines to further the driving zerg imperative of achieving absolute domination. The zerg make no use of technology to create their weapons, armor, or starships. Instead, these functions are efficiently fulfilled through biological adaptation and planned mutation of zerg strains. Even zerg structures are in fact specialized organs within the living, growing organism of a zerg nest.</p>
