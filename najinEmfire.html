										<h3>Najin em-Fire, one of the most inconsistant teams in League Of Legends History, going from best to worst in just 1 season of OGN Champions, currently they are lead by star player, Cho "watch" Jae-geol. </h3>
										<p>Najin e-mFire is a Korean a professional gaming organziation based in South Korea, the original NaJin e-mFire roster was created on February 14th, 2012. Najin em-Fire are a rare team in Korea, as they don't have a StarCraft team, only a League Of Legends one. This teams history is a rather rocky one, at one time being one fo the worst teams in League of Legends but at other times being a top team not just in Korea but the whole world. If we start back at OGN Winter 2012 we can see the first great performance of this organisation, lead by there star toplaner Maknoon, they defeated the legendary Azubu Frost 3 - 0 for a divisive victory. After this the team they in to a dip of form, in the next season of OGN not even qualify for the playoffs. This was a treuly amazing feat that the team that one the previous season and fallen so far, heads had to roll and the star man Maknoon was the first to go. The rest of 2013 after Maknoon left stayed relatively the same, it is not until 2014 that Najin would once again be a truely powerhouse team. After the 2013 season Najin shaked up there roster and added players like Ggoong and Ohq, while releasing legends such as Prey. In the first tournament of the year Najin finally rose back to the play-offs but lost a close series to SK Telecom 3-2. The next season OGN Spring was truely a fairytale ride for Najin, as they made it all the way to the final where they faced a truely monster team in Samsung Blue, lead by the man, the myth, the legend Dade. Najin ended up losing the series 3-1 in a rather convincing fashion, but even though they lost, Najin could still hold there heads high after a great performance. Faster forward to the Korea world qualifier where Najin beat all other teams in the tournament to gain entry to the League Of Legends World Championship. Najin would end up topping there group at the world championship but came up sort against Chinese powerhouse team "OMG". Overall 2014 was a very successful year for Najin which saw them return to the top of E-Sports. In 2015 Najin has been rather disappointing after there 2014 success fans thought that the bad times were over, how wrong they were. OGN Champions Spring 2015 was disastrous for Najin finishing 3rd to last and looking like a team in turmoil. Hopefully the up coming Summer season can provide Najin with a chance for redemption, as of right now though Najin looks to be an organisation with a lot of ground to make up on the truly elite organisations in E-Sports. </p>
