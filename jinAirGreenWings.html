										<h3>Jin Air GreenWings, are a organisation that have a truly world-class team at the very top of it's game and also a mediocre one, maybe in the future this can change, but for now, Jin Air GreenWings is a tale of two worlds.</h3>
										<p>Jin Air Green Wings is the StarCraft II and League Of Legends teams of South Korean airline Jin Air, which flies domestically within South Korea and also to China, Japan, Guam and Southeast Asia. Formerly known as the 8th Team, it is one of the eight KeSPA regulated teams. Jin Air's StarCraft 2 team is certainly a team of high pedigree, with players like Maru, Trap and sOs results are always guaranteed with these players. With recent victories in tournaments such as the WCS World Finals, IEM World Championships and the Korean Starleague this team is all about winning. With their star player sOs winning two world championships during his career it is not without reason to say that he is at the very top of the starCraft 2 E-Sports scene. Beating players like Jaedong, Flash, Life, Innovation and many more. With a list of victories against these all-time great players he truly is Jin-air's StarCraft Ace player, who can always be trusted in those moments when the team needs a victory. Hopefully Jin Air's StarCraft 2 team can continue there good results in the coming year, something tells me they don't have much to worry about in that regard anyway. Now Jin Airs League Of Legends team on the other hand is no where near as success as their StarCraft 2 team. Their League Of Legends team is more of a middle of the pack to low top tier team. They have never truly challenged for the OGN Champions title, normally only reaching the quarter-finals before losing to a top tier team. This OGN Champions 2015 spring season though saw Jin Air become a contender for the crown, if only briefly. They ended up vsing CJ Entus in the quarter-finals and lost 3-0, who would have thought? You can only feel for Jin Air fans. Life goes on and Jin Air are currently competing in the OGN Champions Summer season and as usual are currently placed in the middle of the table, will this finally be the season where Jin Air are able to reach past the quarter-finals and go further? Or will it just be more of the same. Overall Jin Air are a tale of two teams the StarCraft 2 team is at the top of the top, while the League Of Legends team is drowning in mediocrity, Jin Air fans can only hope that there organisation can spread some of that StarCraft 2 magic over there over team in the future. </p>
