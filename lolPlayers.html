											<h3>SK Telecom Faker</h3>

											<p>Lee "Faker" Sang-hyeok was pulled out of solo queue, having previously played the Korea MOBA called Chaos for a few years before the League Of Legends Servers were opened in Korea, he was found by the SK Telecom organization in Season 3 so that a team could be formed around him in the mid lane. Ultimately they settled on Impact, bengi, Piglet, and PoohManDu to surround him and the team was unveiled in February of 2013, dubbed SK Telecom T1 2. They qualified for their first OGN at OLYMPUS Champions Spring 2013. They exceeded all expectations and placed 3rd, losing 3-1 in the semifinals to MVP Ozone but beating CJ Entus Frost 3-0 in the 3rd place match. Faker's dominating performances put him in the conversation for best mid laner in the world after just one tournament. When Season 4 started even better for K at PANDORA.TV Champions Winter 2013-2014. They didn't lose a single game and put up the greatest performance a team has ever had at an OGN tournament. They swept Samsung Ozone in the finals and Faker proved himself as the greatest LoL player of all time after just a year. Since then faker has been the undisputed best League Of Legends player, even when his team loses Faker tries with all his might to carry them to victory sometimes even succeeding. I hope that in the coming years Faker continues to grace us with his great plays.</p>

											<h3>CJ Entus Ambiton</h3>
											<p>Kang "Ambition" Chan-yong was born in Seoul and currently lives in Ilsan. He was 9 years old when he started gaming, and he played StarCraft for a decade. When he started to hear that League of Legends might overtake Starcraft in popularity, he switched over and started playing seriously around the time of Nocturne's release. At first he played primarily AD Carry, focusing on Vayne, but he switched to mid lane when he joined his first competitive team. Ambition's professional career began when he joined MiG Blaze in November of 2011. In the first season of Champions, Blaze upset their sister team, Frost, in a clean 3-0 sweep. In March 2013, both teams were sponsored by CJ Entus and were renamed to CJ Entus Blaze and CJ Entus Frost. After this Blaze went to finish the OLYMPUS Champions Spring 2013 playoffs where they lost 3-0 to MVP Ozone in one of the biggest upsets in League of Legends history. Blaze's next tournament was HOT6iX Champions Summer 2013 where they had their worst result yet, dropping out in the quarterfinals 3-2 to the KT Rolster Bullets. After this CJ went on to have medicore results for the rest of 2014. When 2015 came around Ambition took it upon himself to change his role to jungler so the team could accommodate CoCo. Many people doubted that Ambition could succeed in the jungle, how wrong they were. This 2015 Season has seen Ambition rebron as the true God of Korean League Of Legends. Back to making those death defying plays, that just leave you in a state of shock. Ambiton has helped CJ Entus to reclaim their spot as a top team in Korea. </p>

											<h3>KT Rolster Ssumday</h3>
											<p>Kim "ssumday" Chan-ho was picked up by KT Rolster B on February 27th, 2013 to be their starting top laner. His first tournament was OLYMPUS Champions Spring 2013 where KT B lost in the quarterfinals 3-1 to MVP Ozone. After the tournament, KT B changed their name to the KT Bullets and ssumday was benched in favor of InSec, who was moved top to make room for KaKAO to rejoin the team. He remained on the Bullets as a sub until he was moved to the KT Rolster Arrows as their new starting top laner on October 7th, 2013. In Season 4 the Arrows qualified for HOT6iX Champions Spring 2014 where they upset SK Telecom T1 K to place first in their group. Unfortunately, they lost in the quarterfinals 3-1 to CJ Entus Blaze. The Arrows then attended HOT6iX Champions Summer 2014 where they beat the favorites, Samsung Blue, 3-2 to win the tournament. In Season 5 with the changes to the OGN rules, the Arrows and the Bullets merged to create KT Rolster and ssumday was made the starting top laner. KT participated in SBENU Champions Spring 2015 and placed 5th, narrowly missing play-offs. Overall Ssumday has grown as a player quite well over his past seasons in Champions I for one hope to see him progress even further in the coming year.</p>

												<div class="triviaBox">
												<h4>Trivia</h4>
												<ul>
												<li>1. Chose the username "GorillA" because apparently he looks like gorilla.</li>
												<li>2. Is known as one of the best Lulu supports in Korea.</li>
												<li>3. Re-popularized Janna as a top-tier support in season 4.</li>
												</ul>

											<h3>KOO Tigers Gorilla</h3>
											<p>Kang "GorillA" Beom-hyeon joined NaJin White Shield on June 21st, 2013 as their starting support. He played in his first tournament at HOT6iX Champions Summer 2013 where Shield made it to the quarterfinals but lost 3-0 to CJ Entus Frost. Season 4 started off fairly well for GorillA and his team. They attended PANDORA.TV Champions Winter 2013-2014 where they placed 4th, their highest result ever. Their next tournament was HOT6iX Champions Spring 2014 where they made it to the finals of the whole tournament but lost 3-1 to Samsung Blue. GE started out unarguably the top team in Korea at SBENU Champions Spring 2015 and earned themselves an invitation to the IEM Season IX World Championship in March. However, after defeating Cloud9 and SK Gaming to win their group, they lost 2-1 to Team WE in the semifinals. This defeat was considered by many casters and analysts to be the biggest upset to date in the entire history of League of Legends competition. They qualified for the finals of the OGN play-offs because of their first place finish in the regular season. Unfortunately, they lost 3-0 to SK Telecom T1 in the finals and placed 2nd. Even though Gorilla ended up coming second with his team, you can hardly call it a failure, after all this rookie team including Gorilla has shown great courage and fighting spirit to make it this far in such a short amount of time.</p>

												<h4>Trivia</h4>
												<ul>
												<li>1. Considered a raising star of AD Carrys in Korea with a bright future.</li>
												<li>2. Is known for his baron steals on tristana.</li>

											<h3>NaJin e-mFire Ohq</h3>
											<p>Oh "Ohq" Gyu-min played for several amateur teams, including Virtual Throne Gaming and Xenics Blast but he didn't make it to OGN until he joined Xenics Storm as their new AD. The team played in HOT6iX Champions Spring 2014 but failed to win a single game and dropped out in the group stages. However, Ohq's play was impressive, and he was given an offer to join NaJin Black Sword. He joined on May 16th, 2014, and the team played in HOT6iX Champions Summer 2014 where they made it to the quarterfinals but lost 3-2 to SK Telecom T1 S. In Season 5 due to changes to the OGN rules, Sword and their sister team, NaJin White Shield, were forced to merge, creating NaJin e-mFire. During SBENU Champions Spring 2015, Ohq shared starting time with Shield's former AD, Zefa. NaJin's poor performance in Champions ended with them missing playoffs and taking 6th place overall in a rather unimpressive fashion, as before the tournament started, they were tipped to win it all. But this summer season has seen a new Ohq emerge, he has been on fire, gaining one of the most impressive KDAs in the league, the future is certainly bright for this young AD Carry.</p>
