									<h2>Korean E-Sports Culture</h2>

											<h3 class="cultureHeading">PC Bangs</h3>
											<p>A PC bang is a type of LAN gaming center, where patrons can play multiplayer computer games for an hourly fee. The typical cost for an hour of play ranges from 500 to 1500 won (approximately $0.44 to $1.32 USD.), with 1000 won per hour being the most common cost. Although the per capita penetration of computers and broadband internet access is very high in South Korea, PC bangs remain popular as they provide a social meeting place for gamers (especially school-aged gamers) to play together with their peers. The computer hardware used by PC bangs may be more powerful than the systems available in the players' homes. Most PC bangs allow players to eat, drink and smoke (often with separate smoking and non-smoking sections) while they play. Catering to people who stay for long hours, PC rooms are usually equipped with drinks and snacks (that are bought separately). Popular snacks include ramen cup noodles, coffee in cans, and various chips. Players can also order food from local restaurants.</p>

											<p>The Korean PC bang industry has created a culture that is participated in by most youth in South Korea. Gamers have turned the PC bang into a socialization facility, becoming a huge part in the lives of the Korean youth today. Many students have suggested that the PC-Bang provides a stress free, fun and youth dominated environment where groups of friends can meet and engage in a cooperative game. They have suggested that the games themselves may promote a social environment by promoting the development of squads or groups of players to play the game more effectively.The scale of esports in Korea is certainly the largest in the world. Massive venues such as the Busan Bexco Stadium and Haeundae Beach are constantly packed to the brim with thousands of fans, keen to see their favorite teams and players battle it out. When considered alongside the massive success of Korean pro gamers in a multitude of esports, it’s easy for the average foreign fan to look upon Korea and see it as a haven for esports. A place where masterful pro gamers can hang among the most elite of footballers.
											The Korean government is also on board with competitive gaming and even has a department for the purpose of governing esports, named the Korea e-Sports Association (KeSPA). Huge sponsors such as Samsung, SK Telecom, and Korea Telecom (three of Korea's largest companies -- imagine Google or Comcast sponsoring an esports team) all lend their support to various esports teams in the form of gaming houses, multiple coaches, and equipment.</p>

											<h3 class="cultureHeading">E-Sports on the GO</h3>
											<p>Although it may seem like a given when considering the nature of esports, the Internet has been instrumental in reaching esports audiences. Although stations such as OnGameNet do broadcast esports events on television. The rise of streaming has coincided with the decline of televised esports, signalling a move away from the days where the latest StarCraft tournament would be spectated almost entirely on national television. That being said, esports is not necessarily being shoved out to alternative media. Though it still lacks strong mainstream coverage, the latest esports happenings can now be found on popular mainstream news sites. “The biggest recent step in legitimizing esports in mainstream media has been the push from KeSPA’s president to add an esports tab on Naver. As Naver is essentially Korea’s answer to Google, this move is much larger than it appears. The esports tab is accompanied by stream links and a calendar for upcoming games, allowing even the most uninvested fan to stay up-to-date on Korean esports.</p>
