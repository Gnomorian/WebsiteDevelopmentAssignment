										<h2 class="tourHeading">  What is League Of Legends</h2>
										<figure>

											<figcaption>Gameplay of League Of Legends</figcaption>
										</figure>
										<p>League of Legends is a fast-paced, competitive online game that blends the speed and intensity of an RTS with RPG elements. Two teams of powerful champions, each with a unique design and playstyle, battle head-to-head across multiple battlefields and game modes. With an ever-expanding roster of champions, frequent updates and a thriving tournament scene, League of Legends offers endless replay ability for players of every skill level. The actual game is played by Players who are formed into two even teams primarily comprised of three or five members. Each team starts at opposing sides of a map, near what is called a "Nexus". To win a match, a team must destroy the opposing team's Nexus. To do so, each team must work through a series of towers called "turrets" which are placed along a path to each base (commonly referred to as a "lane"). Along the way, each player gains power by completing game objectives, earning them experience points and gold that are used to increase the player's level and to purchase powerful items, potentially giving players an advantage over their opponents. Examples of these objectives include killing the opposing team's turrets, players, and "minions" (small NPCs that constantly spawn and attack the other team).</p>
										<h2 class="tourHeading">Meta</h2>
										<p>The current meta of League of Legends is typical a tank-like champion on the top lane of the map summoners rift, think of this as someone who takes a lot of damge without really dealing much. In the Middle lane you have ability power casters who specialises in the damage created by the four abilities, "mid" as it is called in-game is normally seen as one of the more important roles on a team. Also there's an attack damage carry champion who specialises in a basic attack damage, commonly called an "adc", now this champions is always ranged and is rather easy to kill most of the time if they are by themselves, this is where the support comes in, which is a utility based champion who's main job is to keep the adc alive so they can keep dealing damage, these two champions are in the bottom lane. The fifth champion of the team is called a jungler who kills the minions inside the jungles located between the 3 lanes and tries to "gank" enemies with the help of his teammates in lane, the ganking term means ganging up on somebody surprisingly. </p>
										<h2 class="tourHeading">Map</h2>
										<p>There are four different maps in League of Legends, Summoner's Rift, The Twisted Treeline, Howling Abyss, The Crystal Scar. Summoner's Rift that is the map that is used in E-Sports. It contains 3 lanes called Top, Mid, Bot and between the lanes there is a space called Jungle, which contains creeps that the player can kill to obtain gold to buy items. This is the normal game mode, the objective is to destroy one another's base. Howling Abyss is a single lane map. The game mode usually played on this is ARAM Short for (All Random All Mid), this is seen as a casual gamemode usually played by casual players or by serious players after a match to cool off. This game mode all champions selected is random. Twisted Treeline is a two lane map made for only 3 champions, it also has a jungle in the middle and is also a casual option that is not played at the E-Sports level. The Crystal Scar is used for the game mode Dominion which's map objective is to capture points on the map.   </p>
										<h2 class="tourHeading">Laning</h2>
										<figure>

											<figcaption>Lanes in League Of Legends</figcaption>
										</figure>
										<p>Lanes are the main paths that minions follow in the course of a game. Lanes are defended by turrets, in order to push the enemy into their base and destroy their inhibitors and Nexus, each successive turret in a lane must be destroyed before damage can be dealt to the next structure. Along each lane are located areas of brush for tactical maneuvering, such as juking and ganking. Controlling a lane is a key tactical component of gameplay; early lane control in a game can put your opponents at a disadvantage by keeping them away from your turrets and denying last hits on minions for much-needed gold. Summoner's Rift has 3 lanes (Top, Bottom and Middle) which are defended by 3 turrets (Outer, Inner, Inhibitor). Each adjacent lane is connected from different points through the Jungle or by the river that runs diagonally through the map. What lane is for you? Right now, the general rule is that one champion goes top, one goes to the jungle, two go bottom, and one goes in the middle. If you are having trouble with the champion(s) you are facing, you should ask someone to switch with you. Around level 30 it starts to get more complicated. There are many combinations, the most popular format of metagame at the moment tends to follow a set pattern of one jungler, a tanky-DPS at top, an ability power reliant caster will go middle and the carry going bottom along with a support champion. This doesnt mean you won't play against different compositions however. </p>
										<h2 class="tourHeading"> Champions</h2>
										<p>There are currently 125 champions in the current champion pool of league, Riot Games develops new champions for League of Legends, and each champion is individually designed to have unique abilities and traits that a player must use wisely. Some champions use brute strength and power, others use deadly and cunning precision, while others use supernatural vision and magic, etc. There were 40 champions released at launch, with one released approximately every two weeks for some time. About 8–10 champions are in development at any moment. Each week there is a rotation of ten champions that are available to play for free.</p>
										<h2 class="tourHeading">Itemisation </h2>
										<p>A champion can only carry six items and a Trinket at a time, making the selection of items an important part of achieving victory. Items are only obtainable through the item shop located at the Spawn Pool. This is also where items are sold back for 70% of the total gold spent to obtain them. Items are divided into six categories: basic, advanced, legendary, mythical, consumable, and trinket. A basic item does not require any other items to be purchased. If an item requires the purchase of at least one specific basic item before it can be purchased, that item is considered an advanced item. All basic items required for the purchase of advanced items are consumed when the advanced item is purchased. The same is true for legendary items, which require the consumption of at least one advanced item, and mythical items, which require the consumption of at least one legendary item. Consumable items are different from other item types in two ways. First, most consumable items may be stacked, allowing duplicates items to occupy the same item slot up to a cap. Secondly, consumable items may be expended to perform a specific function, permanently removing that item from the champion's inventory. On charge-based items such as the Crystalline Flask, the charge is consumable but the item cannot be stacked or consumed.</p>
