										<h3>GE Tigers a newcomer to the E-Sports scene in Korea, but with veteran players such as Prey and Gorilla the height this team can reach seems to be limitless.</h3>
										<p>GE Tigers are a newly formed League Of Legends team in South Korea. Haven't heard of this team? Don't worry not many people would have, but you certainly will from now on. GE Tigers are a team made of of ex-pro players of previous teams who have there sights set on becoming the next big thing in Korean E-Sports. They have only competed in one season of OGN Champions so far, but what a season they had. In the Spring season of OGN Champions 2015 GE Tigers came out of relatively nowhere to become a premier team in League of Legends in Korea. At there inception people thought this might have been a low to mid tier team, how wrong they were, GE Tigers have exploded onto the scene, beating everyone at least once in there debut season. Even reaching the finals where they lost to SK Telecom 3-0, even though they lost this can hardly be considered a failure for such a young team in the League Of Legends scene. They have also attended an international event called IEM Katowice were they faced teams from China, Europe, South East Asia and America. Unfortunately they lost in the semi-finals to the Chinese team W.E., in a series that many consider to be GE Tigers own fault for losing through there cocky champion picks. This Summer season of OGN Champions though has seen GE Tigers struggle to find their form from the previous season and currently find themselves in the bottom half of the table. No one knows what the future holds for this GE Tigers team, will they raise back up to previous height? Or will they return to the obscurity they came from? One can hope that they will return and become a team that is feared and respected for their great play as well as their rags to riches story. </p>
