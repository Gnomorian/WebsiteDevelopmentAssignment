										<h3>CJ Entus, a name that has been associated with E-Sports for more than a decade, known as a organisation addicted to winning and willing to do whatever it takes to be the best there ever was.</h3>
										<p>CJ Entus is a Korean multi-gaming organization originally founded in 2001 under the name "ProSuma." The team eventually changed to the name CJ Entus in April 2006 when Korean conglomerate holding company CJ Group became the team's title sponsor. Along with their League of Legends team, they also sponsor a StarCraft team with a proud Brood War heritage and strong current StarCraft II squad. StarCraft has always been a successful game for CJ Entus and this has continued with StarCraft 2. By far there StarCraft 2 team has been carried by the larger than life character of herO, who has won a major tournament each year since 2013. His most recent victory came in the newly created Kespa Cup, a new tournament created by the government agency Kespa that oversees E-Sports in Korea. You can only imagine the sort of prestige that a tournament like this carries, all the best players attended, Innovation, Life, Maru, Flash and countless others. For herO to win this was him making a statement to the StarCraft 2 community that he is a truly elite level player who is on his way to becoming the undisputed best. CJ Entus League Of Legends team is probably even more successful than there StarCraft 2 side, purely looking at results that is, recently though a case could be made that they had been underachieving. CJ Entus teams have won multiple OGN Championships, both spring and summer for the 2012 seasons. Since then though the League Of Legends team has yet to win another championship in Korea, having made it to the semi-finals and finals multiple times. This year however has seen CJ Entus stay at the top but looking even more likely that they have a chance to win the OGN Championship this Summer season, after coming so close in Spring. In Spring they came so close to defeating the evetual winners of the OGN Championship SKT losing in a reverse sweep 3-2. overall CJ Entus are an organisation with a lot of history, from their past Glory days in StarCraft: Brood war, to the present where they are a powerhouse in both StrarCraft 2 and League Of Legends. If i was describe CJ Entus to somebody i would most likely compare them to Real Madrid, a spanish football team always at the top of the sport, because that is also the same for CJ Entus, always there, always battling for the top honours, always fighting! </p>
